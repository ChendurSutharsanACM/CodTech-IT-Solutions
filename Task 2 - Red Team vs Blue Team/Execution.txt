This scenario explains a blue team (defenders using Wazuh) versus red team (attackers using Hydra) exercise.

Blue Team (Using Wazuh)

Step-by-Step Approach:

1. Setup and Configuration:
   - Ensure Wazuh manager and agents are installed and properly configured across your network.
   - Review and update Wazuh rules related to login attempts, specifically focusing on brute-force attack patterns.

2. Real-Time Monitoring:
   - Use Wazuh’s dashboard or command-line interface to monitor incoming logs and alerts in real-time.
   - Set up alerts for suspicious login activities, such as multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address.

3. Detection and Alerting:
   - Configure Wazuh to detect patterns indicative of brute-force attacks (e.g., multiple failed login attempts within a short period).
   - Ensure alerts are configured to notify security personnel promptly.

4. Incident Response:
   - Upon receiving alerts, investigate the source IP address and targeted usernames involved in the brute-force attempt.
   - Determine if the attack is ongoing and assess its impact.

5. Response and Mitigation:
   - Depending on your organization’s policies, consider responses such as:
     - Temporarily blocking the attacking IP address.
     - Implementing rate limiting or CAPTCHA challenges.
     - Reviewing and enhancing password policies and authentication mechanisms.

6. Post-Incident Analysis:
   - Conduct a thorough analysis of the attack to understand how it was detected and any potential gaps in defenses.
   - Update Wazuh rules and configurations based on insights gained from the attack simulation.

Red Team (Using Hydra for Brute-Force Attack)

Attack Simulation:

1. Select Target:
   - Choose a specific service to target (e.g., SSH, FTP, web application login).

2. Prepare Attack:
   - Use Hydra to launch a brute-force attack against the chosen service.
   - Specify a list of usernames and passwords to attempt.

3. Execute Attack:
   - Run Hydra with appropriate parameters against the target service:
     
     hydra -t 4 -l srj -P passwordfile.txt 192.168.43.173 ssh

4. Monitor Attack Progress:
   - Observe Hydra's output to track login attempts and whether any credentials are successfully compromised.

5. Adapt Tactics:
   - Adjust attack parameters based on responses from the blue team.

6. Document Findings:
   - Record the effectiveness of the attack, including successful compromises and detection evasion tactics used.

Key Takeaways:

- Learning Opportunity: This exercise provides valuable insights into both defensive and offensive security techniques.
- Improvement: Regularly update and refine Wazuh rules and response procedures based on simulated and real-world attack data.
- Team Collaboration: Encourage communication between blue and red teams to enhance overall security posture and incident response readiness.

By simulating such scenarios regularly, organizations can better prepare for real-world cyber threats and improve their overall security resilience.
